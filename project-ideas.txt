- cppyy cling based interop
- bloom filters
- embedded Q-Learning
- semantic similarity tree analysis
- semantic word-vectors for selecting useful functions
- type unification pipelines (map-reduce), with type hints
- (syntactic) levenstein distance and automata
- compile internal automata as C program and use AFL
- compile internal automata as C program and use static analysis (e.g. dead code)
- type unification pipelines using markov probabilities
- embedding of fitness function evaluation into interpreter via BF translation (benefit of hotter code?)
